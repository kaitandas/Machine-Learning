# Project Title : Predicting CO₂ Emissions from Agro-Food Production Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The main goal is to preprocess data, train multiple models, evaluate their performance, and compare results to select the best-performing approach.
